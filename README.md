Getting ready to Pokemon GO launch, it became obviously we need a source of info about
pokemons. In order to do this, we've created a client for https://pokeapi.co/

On click of ‘Load More’ another chunk of the list is being loaded and displayed on the page.
Pokemon details should can be displayed after clicking on the single pokemon in list.
